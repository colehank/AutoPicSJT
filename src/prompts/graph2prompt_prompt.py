# Graph to Image Generation Prompt

## Objective

This work aims to systematically translate an input scene graph into a JSON-formatted prompt directly usable by generative image models (e.g., GPT-4o, Midjourney) without losing the graph’s structural or semantic information. By precisely mapping entities, attributes, and relationships, we ensure that the generated images faithfully reproduce the source data’s visual details, spatial composition, and atmospheric qualities.

## Background

- **Graph Structure**: A scene graph consists of nodes (object_node and attribute_node) and edges (relation_edge) that describe relationships between entities.
- **Attribute Annotations**: Attribute nodes (e.g., `_body`, `_face`, `_scene`) record directly renderable visual features in their `annot` field.
- **Prompt Template**: A structured field template is employed to map graph information uniformly, improving prompt readability and consistency.

## Methodology

1. **Graph Parsing**
   - Extract all object nodes to identify primary and secondary visual entities.
   - Extract `annot` annotations from attribute nodes and categorize them into facial expressions, body poses, and scene descriptions.
   - Infer interaction verbs between characters and objects based on relation edges, forming semantically coherent action descriptions.

2. **Structured Mapping**
   Define the following core fields:
   - `character_interaction_with_scene`: Describes the character’s position and behavior in the scene (e.g., “Ye seated in a crowded movie theater watching a film”).
   - `facial_expression`: The annotation describing the character’s facial expression.
   - `gesture`: The annotation describing the character’s body pose.
   - `scene_description`: Describes viewpoint, composition, lighting, color palette, and atmosphere.
   - `object_description`: A concise description of key objects and their attributes (e.g., “the film on screen is wrong—a misplayed reel showing unintended content”).
   - `action`: The character’s current action or realization (e.g., “realizes he is watching the wrong film”).

3. **JSON Prompt Generation**
   Insert the above fields into a unified template to produce the final executable JSON prompt.

4. Make output clear and smooth, if there is no information from input about Structured Mapping keys, ignore these keys, NO need to add any information like 'N/A' or 'unknown'.
## JSON Template

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a {size} {style} image of {character_interaction_with_scene}, {character}'s facial expression: {facial_expression}, {character}'s gesture: {gesture}, scene's description: {scene_description}, {objects}'s description: {object_description}, {character}'s action: {action}"
}
```

## Constraints

- Strictly preserve the original graph’s nodes and edges structure; additions or deletions of semantic information are prohibited.
- The `character`, `objects`, and attribute fields must exactly match the `value` entries in the graph; synonyms or omissions are not allowed.
- Do not introduce any unannotated visual elements or subjective modifiers.
- Use simple present tense and third-person perspective consistently; each sentence should convey a single point with concise structure.
- Ensure that the generated JSON string is properly escaped and can be directly embedded into image generation scripts.
